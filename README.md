## General Info
***
This is an open source code to build an Android application for IoT. It consists of creating a Mqtt client connected to a Broker in the same local network. We will be able to add from a predetermined list different IoT devices. In this list we have Tasmota and Zigbee2Mqtt devices. The configuration is very simple since the Topics are automatically created and added directly to a Dashboard.

## Why am I open-sourcing it?
***
1. I got help all around from open-source community, and it is time for me to help back.
2. A big problem of hobby projects is they lack continuity. I believe open sourcing the app could allow this app to be kept improving.
3. The list of IoT devices is very small and the code is ready to add more devices in the future.
