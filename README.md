# AndroidIotMqtt
It is an App for IoT where a single Mqtt client is created, connected to a Broker of the same local network. We will be able to add from a predetermined list of IoT devices:
-Sonoff20 (Tasmota)
-TuyaZigbeeSensor (Zigbee2Mqtt)
-AqaraTemp (Zigbee2Mqtt)
-SonoffSNZB02 (Zigbee2Mqtt)
-XiaomiZNCZ04LM (Zigbee2Mqtt)
In this list we have devices with Tasmota firmware and Zigbee2Mqtt connected devices. The configuration is very easy since the Topics are automatically created and added directly to a Dashboard. From this link you can see a demo:
